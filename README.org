#+TITLE: Lambert's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Lambert Green


This is my personal Emacs configuration.

I had started out using a literate configuration, but changed to a pure =elisp= config for the following reasons:
 + I did not end up needing an abundance of comments
 + I prefer a modular config so that updates have more useful diffs
 + Working directly in =elisp= mode makes code execution and debugging easier

* Favorite Themes
** Theme: ~Doom-One~
*** Pros
+ Simply the best all round theme!
+ Great light/dark modes

**** ~diff-hl~ colors
+ Colors match expectation

*** Cons
+ Need something different every now and then

** Theme: ~Cattpuccin~
*** Pros
+ Has a good inbetween light/dark variant
+ ~diff-hl~ colors
  + Colors match expectation

*** Cons
+ Programming modes are little lackluster

** Theme: ~Ef-Dream~
*** Pros
**** =Star Wars= type vibe
+ Has warm ~blues~, ~browns~

**** The background color is pleasant

*** Cons
**** ~diff-hl~ colors
+ Looks simply broken

** Theme: ~Chocolate~
*** Pros
+ =Star Wars= type vibe
+ Has warm ~blues~, ~browns~
+ The background color is pleasant

*** Cons
+ No light mode analog

** Theme: ~Spacemacs~
*** Pros
+ Has one of the best light themes
+ Has great =diff-hl= colors
+ Theme has both ~light~ and ~dark~ modes
*** Cons
+ The =org= colors are not my favorite
** Theme: ~Doom-Badger~
*** Pros
**** =Star Wars= type vibe
+ Has warm ~blues~, ~browns~

**** =Programming modes=
***** Looks good in all programming modes
***** Has ~green~ strings
/Example:/
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "I like green strings")
#+end_src

**** =Org mode=
***** ~TODO~ keywords have a traffic light color
***** DONE key word has a nice strike-out

**** =diff-hl= colors
*** Cons
+ Does not come with a light mode version
**** The background color: is almost black
+ However this works well if using transparency

* PROJ Work-Items
** Open [0/1]
*** TODO Prettify =org-agenda=
+ https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd10q9/comment/hubjy3j

*** TODO Use the faster =Rust= based search tools if installed (=ripgrep=, =fd=) [0/2]
**** [ ] Update =xref=
**** [ ] Update =consult=

** Complete [18/18]
*** DONE In ~use-package~ blocks set ~:ensure t~ as default and remove existing entries
*** DONE Consider all ~:bind~ blocks for ~:general~ applicability
*** DONE Double check Evil packages against Doom's list
*** DONE Update =terminal= to open in bottom
*** DONE Fix issue with =hl-todo= package not installing
*** DONE Update =window management= [2/2]

**** DONE Provide a way to toggle window to max size
I did not find a way to do this in the same way as =Doom Emacs=, however we can use ~delete-other-window~ (~w o~) to make the current window the only window, and then restore to the previous window configuration using ~winner-undo~ (~w u~).

**** DONE Provide a way to undo maximize
Used ~winnner-undo~

*** DONE Add local leader keybinds for ~org-mode-map~ [4/4]

Currently the rollup cookies are not working for checkboxes.  I think you have to define checkboxes as =todo= items.

**** Testing Rollup [3/3]
***** [X] Checkbox one

***** [X] Checkbox two
CLOSED: [2024-05-24 Fri 21:58]

Run the following:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package-report)
  (emacs-init-time)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.584425 seconds

**** Issues
 + We see ~exec-path-from-shell~ is the long pole: 3 seconds
**** Results
+ Disabled ~exec-path-from-shell~ as it does not seem necessary
  + I am not quite sure how the ~env~ is being set
    + =Homebrew= install of =Emacs= does mention the shell env is added to a =plist= file.

*** DONE Fix buffer switching

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"          [2024-07-08 Mon 15:53]
:END:
**** Requirements
+ Project specific buffers
+ Emacs special buffers e.g. *messages*

**** Solution
The =consult= package provides ways to further narrow searches e.g. using a narrowing keymap.
However we still need a workaround for quickly getting to the `*Messages*` window.

*** KILL Fix =EAT= issues [3/3]

process is not running
#+end_quote

**** [X] =EAT= editing modes are hassle still
CLOSED: [2024-07-08 Mon 18:11]
***** Issue
+ I am not sure which mode to be in to quickly copy/paste

**** [X] =EAT= window is not easily moved around
CLOSED: [2024-07-08 Mon 18:11]
***** Issue
+ I cannot easily move the =eat= window around (issue may not be =eat= but more =popper= interaction)
