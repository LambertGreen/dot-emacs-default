#+TITLE: Lambert's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Lambert Green

This is my personal Emacs configuration.

I had started out using a literate configuration, but changed to a pure elisp config for the following reasons:
 - I did not end up needing an abundance comments
 - I prefer a modular config so that updates have more useful diffs
 - Working directly in elisp mode makes code execution and debugging easier

* TODOs [2/2]
** DONE In ~use-package~ blocks set ~:ensure t~ as default and remove existing entries
** DONE Consider all ~:bind~ blocks for ~:general~ applicability
