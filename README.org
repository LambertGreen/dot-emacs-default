#+TITLE: Lambert's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Lambert Green

This is my personal Emacs configuration.

I had started out using a literate configuration, but changed to a pure elisp config for the following reasons:
 - I did not end up needing an abundance comments
 - I prefer a modular config so that updates have more useful diffs
 - Working directly in elisp mode makes code execution and debugging easier

* TODOs
** Open [0/4]
*** TODO Add checkers [0/0]
**** [ ] Spell checker

**** [ ] Progamming linters

*** TODO Port your Doom Org config
*** TODO Update =window management= [1/2]

**** TODO Provide a way to toggle window to max size

**** DONE Provide a way to undo maximize
Used ~winnner-undo~

*** TODO Add support for org checkboxes
Currently the rollup cookies are not working for checkboxes.  I think you have to define checkboxes as =todo= items.

*** TODO Performance analyze Emacs startup
Run the following:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package-report)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<window 11 on *use-package statistics*>

 + We see ~exec-path-from-shell~ is the long pole: 3 seconds

*** TODO Prettify =org-agenda=
+ https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd10q9/comment/hubjy3j
** Complete [3/3]
*** DONE In ~use-package~ blocks set ~:ensure t~ as default and remove existing entries
*** DONE Consider all ~:bind~ blocks for ~:general~ applicability
*** DONE Double check Evil packages against Doom's list
*** DONE Update =terminal= to open in bottom
*** DONE Fix issue with =hl-todo= package not installing
