#+TITLE: Lambert's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Lambert Green

This is my personal Emacs configuration.

I had started out using a literate configuration, but changed to a pure elisp config for the following reasons:
 - I did not end up needing an abundance of comments
 - I prefer a modular config so that updates have more useful diffs
 - Working directly in ~elisp~ mode makes code execution and debugging easier

*** TODO Add support for org checkboxes
Currently the rollup cookies are not working for checkboxes.  I think you have to define checkboxes as =todo= items.

*** TODO Performance analyze Emacs startup
Run the following:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package-report)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<window 11 on *use-package statistics*>

 + We see ~exec-path-from-shell~ is the long pole: 3 seconds

*** TODO Prettify =org-agenda=
+ https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sd10q9/comment/hubjy3j

** Complete [7/7]
*** DONE In ~use-package~ blocks set ~:ensure t~ as default and remove existing entries
*** DONE Consider all ~:bind~ blocks for ~:general~ applicability
*** DONE Double check Evil packages against Doom's list
*** DONE Update =terminal= to open in bottom
*** DONE Fix issue with =hl-todo= package not installing
*** DONE Update =window management= [2/2]

**** DONE Provide a way to toggle window to max size
I did not find a way to do this in the same way as =Doom Emacs=, however we can use ~delete-other-window~ (~w o~) to make the current window the only window, and then restore to the previous window configufation using ~winner-undo~ (~w u~).

**** DONE Provide a way to undo maximize
Used ~winnner-undo~

*** DONE Add local leader keybinds for ~org-mode-map~ [4/4]
**** DONE Add ~clock~ section
**** DONE Add ~dates~ section
**** DONE Add ~tables~ section
***** Another heading
